The dollar rose in quiet European trading this morning, boosted by some large buy orders in a market thinned by a British bank holiday, foreign exchange dealers said. Gold rose slightly in Zurich. ``The market is really dead because London is absent,'' said one trader in Rome. In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins, the dollar gained sharply, closing up 0.70 yen at 134.20 yen. Later, in Europe, it was quoted at 134.25 yen. Foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollar's strong performance in Tokyo to loss-cutting and said orders concentrated there because other major markets were closed. Hong Kong's financial institutions were also closed today for a national holiday. ``Those who had sold the dollar at around 133.80 yen bought it back above the 134-yen level today,'' said a dealer at a U.S. bank's Tokyo office. ``That caused the dollar to gain sharply.'' Other dollar rates in Europe at midmorning, compared with late Friday's London rates: _1.8663 West German marks, up from 1.8565 _1.5760 Swiss francs, up from 1.5655 _6.3372 French francs, up from 6.3010 _2.1077 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0970 _1,386.25 Italian lire, down from 1,380.50 _1.2375 Canadian dollars, up from 1.23725 In Europe, the dollar made solid gains against the British pound. One pound cost $1.6855, compared with $1.7025 in London late Friday. The London bullion markets were closed for the holiday, but in Zurich the bid price for gold was $432.35, up slightly from $432.00 bid late Friday.

Bloodstains on a pillowcase and exercise bar found in Joel Steinberg's apartment came from his former lover, an FBI expert testified at Steinberg's trial on charges he beat his illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter to death. Hedda Nussbaum, who lived with Steinberg for 12 years, has testified that Steinberg beat her on the head and legs with the bar. FBI serologist Robert J. Grispino testified Thursday that was ``100 percent'' certain the bloodstains were not from Steinberg, Steinberg's daughter, Lisa; or Steinberg's illegally adopted son, Mitchell, who has since been returned to his natural mother. Grispino's testimony came Thursday afternoon after the morning session was canceled because judge Harold Rothwax suffered two broken wrists when he was hit by a car as he rode his bicycle to work. Rothwax's wrists were put in casts. When the 58-year-old judge returned to the courtroom, he followed doctors' orders to keep his arms elevated by sitting with his elbows on the desk and hands in front of his face. As the session proceeded, his clerk had to put his glasses on for him and turn pages for him. ``I regret being delayed today,'' he told jurors at the end of the day. ``I'm going to try to come down (to court) safely tomorrow. You try to come down safely, too.'' Lisa's death last year in an affluent, well-educated household shocked many New Yorkers and led to a re-examination of the duty and ability of neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report evidence of child abuse.
When Ron Thompson sat down for lunch on New Year's Eve, he was the grandfather of five. At breakfast Monday, he was a grandfather of nine. Three of Thompson's daughters _ Mary Tolson, Joan Thompson and Carol Thompson _ gave birth to four boys at Seton Medical Center late Sunday and early Monday. When Ms. Tolson went into labor Sunday, she asked her 19-year-old sister Joan, who was in the ninth month of her pregnancy, to drive her to the hospital. After about five hours, Ms. Tolson, 28, gave birth at 2:40 p.m. to Shane Taylor Tolson, who weighed 7 pounds 9 ounces. At Ms. Tolson's delivery, Dr. Chris Seeker said Joan told him, ``You will probably be seeing me, too.'' Sure enough, seven hours later Joan was hustled to Seton by sister Carol. Joan gave birth to Jeremy Andrew Thompson Armendariz at 12:01 a.m. He weighed 6 pounds 10 ounces. Carol, 24, then went into labor and gave birth to twin boys just before 3 a.m. The mothers and four boys spent New Year's Day in good condition. ``This beats partying,'' Joan said. ``At least I have a (sense of) relief and not a headache.''
A Navy anti-submarine helicopter crashed while preparing to land on a frigate in the North Arabian Sea and its three crewmen were presumed dead, officials announced Friday. The SH-2F helicopter was returning to the USS Barbey at the end of a dawn flight and crashed on approach, said Ken Mitchell, spokesman for North Island Naval Air Station. The Barbey is based at San Diego. The crash occurred about 7 p.m. PST Thursday, Mitchell said. Lost and presumed dead were Lt. Cmdr. Gerald C. Pelz, 37, of Coronado, Calif., Lt. j.g. Gerald T. Ramsdell, age unknown, of Ridgewood, N.J., and the anti-submarine warfare operator, Petty Officer 3rd Class William E. Martinie, 24, of Peoria, Ill. Helicopters from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, 70 miles away, and boats from the Barbey and USS California unsuccessfully searched for survivors. The craft was part of Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light 33.
